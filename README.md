# Text Sentiment Classification
This is the code repo of project "Twitter Sentiment Classification" in the Computational Intelligence Lab of ETH Zurich, 
Spring 2020. 

The framework  structure of this repo is inspired by Zhifei Yang: https://github.com/Xivid/cil-text-classification-2018.

The project structure is modified from https://github.com/srviest/char-cnn-text-classification-pytorch

The main idea of this project is to use character-level embedding to outperform the word-embedding method with pretrained BERT.
